### ü§òüèª Profile
A developer who believes in the power of communication and soft skills. <br/>

I am currently part of the development team at Hurb. Fascinated by learning and sharing what I know, I feel comfortable being around professionals who seek growth. Communication and curiosity are my keywords.

At Berrytech, I contributed to the release of Maia platform and was able to further enhance my skills and toolbox with TypeScript, GraphQL, Tailwind, Legend State, shadcn/ui and AI integrations.

At Speedio, I was responsible for improving the Atlas platform, developing features, fixing bugs, and ensuring the quality, clarity, and integration of the interface with the backend. I used Vue.js with Quasar, Overmind, and MongoDB. It was also where I had my first contact with RabbitMQ, Elastic Search and CRM integrations.

I started my dev journey as a freelancer at an agency called SM Creative Marketing, where I developed projects for small and medium-sized businesses using the MERN stack. Before that, I worked as a teacher at Microlins and, for years, provided services as a Web Designer at UERJ/FFP.
