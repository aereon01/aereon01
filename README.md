 
### ü§òüèª Profile
Passionate about learning, sharing knowledge, and being around professionals who strive for growth. Communication and curiosity are my key attributes.

I am currently part of the engineering team at Hurb, where I worked on the Packages team and currently contribute to the Interfaces team in a React.js/Next.js + Tailwind, GraphQL, and SQL environment.
Before that, I worked on restructuring a business management platform at a startup, where I was able to enhance my skills and tools with TypeScript, GraphQL, Legend State, shadcn/ui, and AI integrations.

I was also responsible for improving a B2B and B2C lead sales platform integrated with multiple CRMs, developing features and fixing bugs. The stack included Vue.js + Quasar, Overmind, and MongoDB. This role also gave me my first exposure to RabbitMQ, Elastic Search and Docker.

I began my journey as a freelancer at an agency where I developed projects for small and medium-sized businesses using the MERN stack. Before that, I worked as an informatics teacher and, for years, provided services as a web designer and freelancer.
